            <p>It’s only been our first year, but it feels like I’ve known you for so long. Yet somehow, I’m still learning about you and loving you more each day. Every second with you feels like comfort. I won’t take it for granted because every time, I get reminded of how lucky I am to have someone support me like you do. </p>
            
            <p>To me, it’s the little things that mean the most – like how you always notice when something’s wrong and pull me in for a hug, or when you laugh at my silly jokes, or when you cook me that meal I mentioned earlier in the week. You make me feel safe and understood, and I’m forever grateful for you Bubba.</p>

            <p>I will never be able to express into words everything I feel, but one thing is for certain – I don’t think I’ll ever stop being amazed at how you make life feel brighter. You have the cutest hobbies, the sweetest love language, the most thoughtful gestures and you’re one of the strongest people I know. </p>

            <p>Of course, there have been moments when things weren’t exactly easy. But through it all, thank you for always choosing to communicate with me. And for giving me a safe space to make my own mistakes and also try to communicate with you. You’ve shown me what a calm and supportive love looks like, and I can’t wait for all the memories we’ll continue to make – good or bad.</p>

            <p>คิดถึงนะ และรักนะ. I love you endlessly.</p>

            <p>Yours and your fav,</p>
            <p><strong>Aiana</strong></p>
